# Machine Learning Project in Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques using **Jupyter Notebook**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Model Building**: Implemented various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized data and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: All steps are executed in an interactive Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning models and algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and running the project interactively.
